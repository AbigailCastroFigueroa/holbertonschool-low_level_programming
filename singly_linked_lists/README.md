# Singly linked list

### Description
In this project we are going to learn what are singly linked list, and how to use them performing simple tasks. 

#### General requirements

>- We are only allowed to use vi, vim or emacs as text editors.
>- The use of global variables it's not allowed.
>- The header file must be include guarded.
>- The header file should have all the prototypes given.
>- The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit.
>- No more than 5 functions per file

#### Compilation
As compilation method we use gcc using given flags as follow, including at the end the .c files:
> gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 

#### Tasks
>- Task 0 - we create a function that prints all the elements in the linked list along with it's content.
>- Task 1 - create a function that only prints the amount of elements.
>- Task 2 - write a function that add a node at the beggining of the list.
>- Task 3 - write a function that add a node at the end of the list.
>- Task 4 - write a function that frees the list.
